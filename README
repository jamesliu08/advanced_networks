NOTE: Scripts require root access as my traceroute runs use -I to send ICMP packets (got better results) and pchar requires root access.

To run scripts and append output to files, use the following command:

python3 sequence_one.py | tee -a seq1_jliu08.txt

Or similar command for other sequences.

For sequence_two, I used python requests' built in 'elapsed' property to get the time instead of manually recording the
start and end times and calculating the difference. I hope this is acceptable as it seems to me as it would be more accurate.

I purposely chose to leave output up to the user in case they wished to write to a different file or simply send to stdout

BONUS:

Parsing bonus scripts simply involves running:

python3 parse_seq_one.py

Or similar command for other sequences. I outputted rows of the csv in the order they appeared in the output of my code.
I believe this is a sensible decision as a csv can be easily sorted in another program such as Excel, or with a script, so
the option of how that is sorted should be up to the user.
